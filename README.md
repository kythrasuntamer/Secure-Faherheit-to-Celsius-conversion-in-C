Takes input from the user and converts Faherheit to Celsius.
it approximates.

Was working the K&R  book but I had to do it a completely non standard way  just to blow prospective employers minds.

I'm  brand new, studying C with it , I like C already.

it's fast, compared to languages that have to be interepted.

makes better use of computing resources.    

This shows promise from a brand new developer in the language.

compile with cl.exe /nologo /Ox /MT /W0 /GS- /DNDEBUG /I "path to the .h file" faherheit_to_celsius.c /link /OUT:faherheit_to_celsius.exe /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE /MACHINE:x64
